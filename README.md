# dl

dl is a neural network library. I haven't specified an RNN class but we can still use RNNs by computing gradients using the backward method in the Model class. LSTMs need a seperate implementation though. GANs/Autoencoders are simple enough to implement using dense layers but in order to do cool stuff like make human faces, art and so on, we need CNNs.
