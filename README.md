### dl.py
dl is a small library I made to understand how neural networks and gradient descent optimizers work. I have benchmarked momentum, Adam and RMSprop on MNIST and used dl for simple problems like modelling logic gates. dl can also be used to implement simple reinforcement learning algorithms like REINFORCE, policy gradient or vanilla DQL.
